                On average, males weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone). They need
                this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride. Lions can eat up to 40kg of
                meat in a single meal - around a quarter of their body weight. Their tongues have sharp-pointed rasps,
                called papillae, which are used to scrape meat off the bones. There are thought to be as few as 23,000
                lions left in the wild. When you think there are around 415,000 wild African elephants, you realise lion
                numbers are incredibly low. In fact, lions have disappeared from over 90% of their historical range.

                Lions play a key role in the food chain by helping to control the herbivore population. If the herbivore
                population is not regulated, the increase of competition among them would cause some to go extinct and
                thus reduce biodiversity. The lions have a reputation of being the ‘chief’ predator of their habitat as
                they are known to even kill large herbivores such as elephants and giraffes.
