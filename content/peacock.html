                Peahens build their nests on the ground, in a shallow hole padded with grass. They usually make their
                nests in areas that are sheltered by bushes, shrubs, or other vegetation, to keep the eggs safe from
                predators. A peacock’s tail feathers can reach up to six feet long and make up about 60 percent of its
                body length. Despite these odd proportions, the bird flies just fine, if not very far.

                Peacock is the national bird of India and hence very important for the Indians. It is really a rare and
                lovely sight for the beauty-loving people. So the peacock has rightly been chosen as the national bird
                of our country. Its rhythm of gait, it’s a keenness to the green vegetation, its keen response to the
                changing season-all have drawn. It is closer to the poet than any other bird. The Indian sub-continent
                is the native place of the peacock and they are found in different other parts of Asia. The male peacock
                is good looking but the female peacock is very ugly to look. It has two rough legs and a long beak. The
                most beautiful part of a male peacock is its long tail. One of the most beautiful sights in the world of
                birds is that of a peacock displaying the beauty of its glittering tail features.
